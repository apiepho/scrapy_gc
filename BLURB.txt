scrapy_gc - 
This simple tool uses the Python based scrapy framework to crawl pages from craigslist and
parse all the entries for a given category.  This is a "sharpen the ax project" to learn
how scrapy works.  

This is a follow on to gc_app written in Ruby, with scrapy being much faster.  Applying
scrapy to craigslist is the first stepping stone to other projoects involving more
complicated web sites (with login screens and links that must be scraped).
